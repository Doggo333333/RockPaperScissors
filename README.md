# RockPaperScissors
 This is a simple game of rock paper scissors that you as a user can play with an AI. You type in your answer and the code will keep track of all your score and the Ai score. The first to 10 points wins.

This game was created to flex my skills in loops and nested loops as well as creating a low strategy level AI. (10/12/2022)
